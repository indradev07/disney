## 📦 Component Breakdown

This application is built using the **Lit** library with a focus on modular Web Components, each encapsulating its own logic, styles, and events.

- `<app-shell>` – Main shell handling routing (`/explore`, `/favorites`) and rendering pages  
- `<home-page>` – Manages stateful logic like data fetching, filtering, and character selection  
- `<search-bar>` – Autocomplete input with keyword highlighting and input debouncing  
- `<filter-panel>` – Dropdowns for filtering by **franchise**, **role**, and **era**  
- `<results-grid>` – Displays a paginated list of `<character-card>` components  
- `<character-card>` – Represents an individual character with favorite toggle and image  
- `<character-profile>` – Modal popup for detailed character view  
- `<favorites-page>` – Displays saved favorite characters using `<favorites-panel>`  
- `<favorites-panel>` – Renders a list/grid of favorited characters  
- `<skeleton-card>` – Reusable loader placeholder shown during API data fetch

---

## 🧠 Filter Architecture

Filters are declarative and composable. State is derived and applied at runtime via a central filter mechanism inside home-page.

- `<filter-panel>` manages filter state and emits `filter-change` events  
- `<home-page>` listens to these events and applies filtering logic:

  - **Franchise**: Matches any string within the `films[]` array  
  - **Role**: Matches the `role` property (e.g., Hero, Villain, Sidekick)  
  - **Era**: Matches the `era` property (mocked/classified in the dataset)  
  - **Search Term**: Comes from `<search-bar>`,
 
- matched against character `name` and `keywords`

All filters and the search term are **combined together** for efficient in-memory filtering — no additional network requests are made.

---

## 🚀 UI Performance on Large Data Sets

```bash
Pagination in <results-grid> shows 10 characters per page
Skeleton loading cards improve perceived performance
Efficient filtering and searching on in-memory data – no re-fetching
Isolated reactivity via Lit components keeps DOM updates scoped
```

## 🛠️ Optional Build

```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a minified output in the dist/ folder.
